Version 1.2
Fixed bug where it would miss the first partition. Might be caused by a
different fdisk version or disk type.
Instead of taking line 10+ it now greps for the partition table header (the
line containing 'Device Boot Start' etc.) and takes all lines below that.

Version 1
Initial working version
